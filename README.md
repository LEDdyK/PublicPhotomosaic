# Photomosaic

## Running the application

### Jar file

To run the application, download the PhotoMosaicParaTask.jar file and run it by double-clicking on it.

Please make sure that before you click 'run computations' that you have a reference image selected and that
the Library Scale field is a double, and the Threads/Cell Height/Cell Width values are integers.

Note that a Mosaic will not be built if your Mosaic would have exceeded a certain number of pixels. This is to prevent potential OutOfMemoryErrors.
In this case, you will get a message telling you so, so please either reduce the Library scale or increase the Cell sizes

### Ant build

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and run the 'runParaTaskJar' Ant build process
